# No Recruiter Soliciting

The presence of this repository in my GitHub profile indicates that I do not wish to be contacted with solicitations for job opportunities at this time. I am happy with my current position and do not intend to leave it in the forseeable future. If you contact because you felt my GitHub profile made me a perfect fit for your opportunity I will know that you are either:

 * Lying, and have not looked though my repositories at all.
 * Lazy, and did not look through my repositories very thoroughly.
 * Playing dumb, and have purposefully ignored this message.

Any of the above are ample reason for me to not want to work for you, no matter how "amazing" your opportunity is. 

I am still open to usage questions, bug reports, feature requests, and other technical inquiries about my projects.

Thank you for your respect and consideration!
